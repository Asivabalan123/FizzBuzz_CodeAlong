Test Driven Development Process

FizzBuzz prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems. The first problem is finding the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. The second problem is showing the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, and finding the sum of all even-valued terms.

These were carried out using the Test driven development process. This consists of the red, green and refactor stage, which is making the test fail, then making it pass and then refactoring it.

These were carried out using the Test driven development process. 
It includes 3 stages:

RED (Write a test that fails)
GREEN (Write a test that passes)
REFACTOR (Change code for better, by ensuring its the most efficient)
